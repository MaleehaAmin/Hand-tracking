 This project consists of two Python scripts, angle.py and tracking.py, aimed at calculating and analyzing angles from live hand tracking data. The angle.py script reads a CSV file containing coordinates of points, computes angles between consecutive triplets using the getAngle function, converts the angles from degrees to radians, and saves the results to a new CSV file. The tracking.py script uses the Mediapipe library to detect and track hand landmarks in real time via a webcam feed. It identifies landmark positions, calculates angles between joints of a specified finger, and saves these angles to a CSV file for further analysis. Additionally, it displays the hand tracking visualization in a webcam feed with a frame rate overlay, enabling real-time gesture or motion tracking.
